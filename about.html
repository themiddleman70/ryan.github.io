<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Although being born in Iowa in 1995, I am currently living in Texas.  However, this wasn't my initial move.  After leaving Iowa, I moved to Georgia, Utah, and Texas, where I graduated high school at Friendswood High School in 2014
as well as receiving an Associate of Science in Computer Science in December 2016 at San Jacinto College, along with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science in May 2019 from Texas State 
University.</p>

<p>After receiving my bachelor's degree, I had made it my goal to move back to Utah because I felt that Utah was home to me due to the beautiful views that the state has to offer.  Not only that, but I had made some very good friends
while living there that I'm still in contact to this day.  In November 2020, that dream happened as I received a job offer from SelectHealth in Salt Lake City.  I lived and worked there for the next 2.5 years.  However, in July 2023,
some personal issues arose to where I could no longer live and work in Utah, so I moved back to Texas to live with my parents, where I am still to this day.  However, my dream is to move back up there to Utah, and hopefully continue
to live and work there for as long as I can.</p>

<h3>Fun Stuff</h3>

<p>I am an avid baseball fan.  I have loved watching baseball since I was introduced to it by my father way back in 2005.  From that day, I have learned a lot about it, and have been following it closely over the last several years,
especially my favorite team, the St. Louis Cardinals.  I used to play baseball when I still lived in Iowa, however, I was still in the early stages of understanding baseball and liking it the way I do now, and wasn't a good or great
player.</p>

<p>I am a gamer, and have always been one since I was a little kid with my PlayStation 1.  I have been a PlayStation fan up to this date, and have owned all the major PlayStations, PlayStation 1 to the PlayStation 4.  Unfortunately,
the PlayStation 1 is the only console, outside of the portable ones that I never owned, that I currently do not have or own.  My favorite console games include MLB The Show, Need for Speed, amongst others.  Over the last couple of
years, I have started to switch over to PC gaming.  I bought my first gaming computer in the spring of 2021, which I still currently own.  On my PC, I own a lot of simulation games, including American Truck Simulator, Euro Truck
Simulator 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator, amongst others.  I also play GTA roleplay through FiveM, where I've held the roles of Director of Communications/Dispatch, Civilian Director, Sheriff, as well as Community Director/Owner over 
the last several years.</p>

<p>I am also an amateur photographer, and have been for the last several years.  I haven't done much photography recently, however I do plan on getting back into the swings of photoraphy.  I mostly take pictures of nature, so any
places that has trees, mountains, lakes, etc., are focal points for me to take the best shots.  I first got into photography when I took a digital photography course while I was a junior in high school in Utah.  Ever since then,
I have been finding ways and places to go to so that I can take the best photos that I can.</p>
